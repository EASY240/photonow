AI Image Generator
Overview
Welcome to the LightX AI Image Generator API V2 Documentation. Our AI Image Generator API converts text prompts into visually compelling images with high precision. It provides flexibility for customizing image attributes, including color schemes, textures, and compositions, to align with the intended narrative and artistic vision. Advanced algorithms always deliver images that accurately reflect the descriptive inputs. Discover the Full Guide to Begin!

AI Image Generator API Rollout
To access your AI Image generator API, you need to generate an API key. Visit the LightX API to retrieve your key. Use text prompts to generate amazing images, whether in anime, realistic, 3D, pixel art, painting, or other styles. Each generation will cost you 1 credit with the output delivered in 1024x1024, JPEG format.

Quick Steps to Generate with Your API
Going Forward, use cURL along with x-api-key and your API key (as given below) to generate images with AI. Next, proceed to the "Body" tab to configure the request payload according to the required format and input data as required. Finally, click "Send" to submit the request.

cURL

 Method- Post
curl --location 'https://api.lightxeditor.com/external/api/v1/text2image' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: <Insert your API Key>' \
--data '{
"textPrompt": "YourInputPrompt"  // Replace with your specific input prompt
}'

Once your request is completed, visualize the "Response" to verify that the API call is executed successfully (as given below).

Response
{
   "statusCode": 2000,
   "message": "SUCCESS",
   "body": {
       "orderId": "7906da5353b504162db5199d6",
       "maxRetriesAllowed": 5,
       "avgResponseTimeInSec": 15,
       "status": "init"
   }
}

orderId: This key is the unique identifier for the order.
maxRetriesAllowed: The number of retries a user can attempt when the status is "init".
avgResponseTimeInSec: This is the average time the machine can take to generate the output.
Status: There are only two scenarios: "init" = proccessing, and "failed" = error.

Once your order Id is generated, input it into the status check system to retrieve and review the results of your API Tool (mentioned below).

Check Status
cURL

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.lightxeditor.com/external/api/v1/order-status' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: <Insert your API Key>' \
--data '{
"orderId": "insert your Order ID"
}'

After hitting orderId as request payload in your check status make sure you make a subsequent API call which means, in every 3 seconds you can hit until you get "status": "active"

note
The maximum time for receiving output is 15 seconds. You are allowed up to 5 retries for checking the status, with each API call being made every 3 seconds. You need to repeatedly call this API up to 5 times until you receive a status of as active/failed. In case of failed status, no credit will be deducted. When the status is "active," the relevant output will be included in the output attribute of the response.

Output
{
   "statusCode": 2000,

       "status": "active",
       "output": "https://example.com/your-outputimage.jpg"
