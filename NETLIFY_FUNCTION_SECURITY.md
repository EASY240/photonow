# Netlify Serverless Function Security Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the Netlify serverless function for dynamic environment variable access and secure API key handling.

## Key Security Features

### 1. Runtime Environment Variable Access
- **Dynamic Reading**: Environment variables are read at runtime using `process.env`, not at build time
- **Validation**: All environment variables are validated before use
- **Secure Retrieval**: The `getSecureEnvVar()` function provides secure access with validation

### 2. API Key Security
- **Runtime Validation**: API keys are validated for format and length
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are stored in Netlify environment variables (not in code)
- **No Logging**: API key values are never logged, only their presence is confirmed

### 3. Input Validation
- **JSON Parsing**: Safe JSON parsing with error handling
- **Endpoint Validation**: Endpoint parameters are validated for type and format
- **Request Body Validation**: Request bodies are validated as proper objects

### 4. Error Handling
- **Standardized Responses**: All errors use the `createErrorResponse()` function
- **Detailed Logging**: Errors are logged with full details for debugging
- **No Sensitive Data**: Error responses never expose sensitive information

### 5. Request Security
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout prevents hanging requests
- **CORS Headers**: Proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- **User Agent**: Custom User-Agent header for API identification
- **Cache Control**: No-cache headers prevent sensitive data caching

## Environment Variables Required

### Production Environment
Set these in your Netlify dashboard under Site Settings > Environment Variables:

```
LIGHTX_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Development Environment
For local testing, create a `.env` file in the `netlify/functions` directory:

```
LIGHTX_API_KEY=your_test_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **No Build-Time Dependencies**: Environment variables are accessed at runtime only
2. **Input Sanitization**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes
4. **Logging Controls**: Sensitive information is never logged
5. **Timeout Protection**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
6. **CORS Security**: Proper CORS configuration for web security

## Testing the Function

### Local Testing
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Run locally: `netlify dev`
3. Test endpoint: `http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/lightx-proxy`

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
3. Test with your application

## Deployment Notes

- **No Redeployment Required**: Environment variable changes take effect immediately
- **Zero Downtime**: Function updates don't require application restarts
- **Secure by Default**: All security features are enabled by default

## Monitoring and Debugging

- **Development Mode**: Detailed logging when `NODE_ENV` is not "production"
- **Error Tracking**: All errors are logged with stack traces
- **Performance Monitoring**: Request/response timing information available
