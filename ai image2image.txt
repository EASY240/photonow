AI Image to Image
Overview
Welcome to the LightX AI Image to Image API Documentation. The AI Image to Image API transforms your input images into completely new versions. You can adjust features like style, composition, or details while keeping the original image's key elements intact. It’s perfect for creative projects, marketing visuals, or reimagining photos with a fresh perspective. Discover the Full Guide to Begin!

note
In strength, the Higher style strength makes the generated image look more like your imageUrl, reducing the strength makes it appear less similar. In styleStrength, the Higher style strength makes the generated image look more like your styleImageUrl, while lower strength makes it look less similar.

AI Image to Image API Rollout
To access your AI Image to Image API, you need to generate an API key. Visit the LightX API to retrieve your key. Insert your image URL, strength and text prompt or add a style image to generate images. Each generation will cost you 1 credit with the output delivered in JPEG format.

note
Make sure to use the public image URL for the imageUrl and styleImageUrl to prevent any failure status.

Quick Steps to Generate with Your API
Going Forward, use cURL along with x-api-key and your API key (as given below) to generate images with AI. Next, proceed to the "Body" tab to configure the request payload according to the required format and input data as required. Finally, click "Send" to submit the request.

cURL

  Method- Post
curl --location 'https://api.lightxeditor.com/external/api/v1/image2image' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: <Insert your API Key>' \
--data '{
"imageUrl": "https://example.com/your-image.jpg",  // Replace with the URL of your input image
"strength" : 0.5,  // Keep it between 0.0 to 1
"textPrompt": "YourInputPrompt",  // Replace with your specific input prompt
"styleImageUrl": "https://example.com/your-style-image.jpg",  // Replace with the URL of your input style image
"styleStrength" : 0.9  // Keep it between 0.0 to 1
}'


Once your request is completed, visualize the "Response" to verify that the API call is executed successfully (as given below).

Response
{
   "statusCode": 2000,
   "message": "SUCCESS",
   "body": {
       "orderId": "7906da5353b504162db5199d6",
       "maxRetriesAllowed": 5,
       "avgResponseTimeInSec": 15,
       "status": "init"
   }
}

orderId: This key is the unique identifier for the order. maxRetriesAllowed: The number of retries a user can attempt when the status is "init". avgResponseTimeInSec: This is the average time the machine can take to generate the output. status: There are three scenarios: "init" = proccessing, "failed" = error.

Once your order Id is generated, input it into the status check system to retrieve and review the results of your API Tool (mentioned below).

Check Status
cURL

curl --location --request POST 'https://api.lightxeditor.com/external/api/v1/order-status' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: <Insert your API Key>' \
--data '{
"orderId": "insert your Order ID"
}'

After hitting orderId as request payload in your check status make sure you make a subsequent API call which means, in every 3 seconds you can hit until you get "status": "active"

note
The maximum time for receiving output is 15 seconds. You are allowed up to 5 retries for checking the status, with each API call being made every 3 seconds. You need to repeatedly call this API up to 5 times until you receive a status of as active/failed. In case of failed status, no credit will be deducted. When the status is "active," the relevant output will be included in the output attribute of the response.

Output
{
   "statusCode": 2000,
   "message": "SUCCESS",
   "body": {
       "orderId": "7906da5353b504162db5199d6",
       "status": "active",
       "output": "https://example.com/your-outputimage.jpg"
   }
