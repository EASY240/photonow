    question: "Will the background look natural after removing people?",
    answer: "Yes! Our AI Cleanup Tool uses advanced algorithms to analyze the surrounding textures, patterns, and lighting to create a natural-looking fill for the removed areas. The result is typically indistinguishable from the original background, especially in natural settings like landscapes, beaches, or architectural photos."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any technical skills to use these tools?",
    answer: "Not at all. Both our AI Cleanup and AI Replace tools are designed for users of all skill levels. The intuitive interface guides you through the process, and the AI handles all the complex work behind the scenes. If you can use a smartphone app, you can use our tools."
  },
  {
    question: "How does AI Replace differ from basic object removal?",
    answer: "While object removal (like our AI Cleanup Tool) focuses on erasing unwanted elements and filling in the background, AI Replace takes this a step further by allowing you to substitute the removed element with something new. This gives you creative control to enhance your photos rather than just cleaning them up."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of photos work best with these tools?",
    answer: "Both tools work well with most photo types, but you'll get the best results when: the person to be removed doesn't overlap with your main subject, the background has consistent patterns or textures, the lighting is even across the image, and the photo has good resolution and clarity. That said, our advanced AI can handle challenging scenarios too, including complex backgrounds."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit to how many people I can remove?",
    answer: "There's no technical limit to how many people you can remove from a photo. However, for best results, we recommend removing people in smaller groups rather than all at once if your photo contains many people. This gives the AI more surrounding context to work with for each removal."
